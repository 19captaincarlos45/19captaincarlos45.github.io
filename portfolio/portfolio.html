            <h1><strong><em>Introduction&nbsp;</em></strong></h1>
            <p class="text-left">The main goal and aim of my website is to educate and inform the general public about the holocaust. The website will focus on two periods of time of the holocaust. One before the war during 1933-1939. This section will mainly cover Kristallnacht, and the Nuremberg laws and how the Third Reich slowly excluded Jews from German society.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="text-left">The other section will focus on what happened in the holocaust during the second world war between the end of 1939-1945. This section will explain the mass deportations of jews to the concentration and extermination camps, as well as explaining what the prisoners in the camps had to go through. This section will also cover when the various camps were found and liberated by the western allies and the Soviet Union.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="text-left">One of the reason why I have decided to make my website on this topic is that I am a current ambassador for the Holocaust Educational Trust, and I feel that since I am an ambassador and I have been given an opportunity to create a website, it should be about a topic that I am thoroughly passionate about learning and want to understand better, and one that I am somewhat involved in to spread awareness.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="text-left">The target audience for my website would be mainly students in college and above. This is because these types of people are more likely to be researching about this topic for a school project. However since this websites ultimate goal is to spread awareness of the holocaust the target audience is not limited to just students, but instead targets anybody who wants to learn more.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="text-left">The selected approach, my website is quite basic in terms of its layout and structure. This is because I want the website to be more easily navigated which allows people to find what they are searching for. Another reason is that the websites primary objective is to inform. To overly stylise the website might distract website goers from the content it provides, especially since the topic can be sensitive in some areas.</p>

<p class="text-left"><strong><em> How has current internet technology impacted communication, the individual, and the collective?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
            <p class="text-left">For communication, the individual, and the collective, internet technology has positively impacted these groups in many ways. For communication and the collective, internet technology has allowed people to be able to communicate with other people from around the world far easily than before which is not just limited to text messaging, phone calls and letters. This has allowed groups of people with similar interests and ideas to come together and talk and discuss with one another, who before might have been unable to do so for instance being in different countries around the world. and because of this it has allowed them to spread awareness of their projects far more easily to a larger audience than if it was locally. Another way it has impacted communication is that people now can gain almost instant access to bits of news and information, and to keep up to date with global affairs.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="text-left">In terms of the individual, the development and improvement of internet technology has enabled certain people, for instance people who are blind and visually impaired, or who have physical disabilities to be able to gain access to sources of information or has opened up new ways for those people to be able to communicate with others to a level where they have not had the opportunity to do so before. </p>
