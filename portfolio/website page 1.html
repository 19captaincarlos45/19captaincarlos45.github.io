		    Nuremberg Laws&nbsp;&nbsp; </h3>
			<p class="text-left"> <small>In 1935, at the annual party rally that was held in Nuremberg, new laws regarding Jews in Germany were announced. These laws excluded German Jews from Reich citizenship and prohibited them from being allowed to marry or have sexual relationships with people the Nazi’s described as having ‘German or related blood.'&nbsp;</small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><small>As more laws came into effect, these further excluded German Jews from nearly every aspect of society. German Jews soon found out that they were not allowed to fly the German flag, not allowed the right to vote, cannot occupy public office and were banned from certain public places. &nbsp;</small></p>
<img src="../images/nuremberg race laws.png" alt="Bootstrap Image Preview" width="600" class="img-fluid">
		  
		  <p class="text-center"><small><strong><em>A chart from the Nuremberg Laws explaining 'German-blood'</em></strong></small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><small>One Jewish woman described how the laws affected her. <em>“We were told that there were certain rules we had to follow from now on. One was not to go to public school. I recall the laws being set down one by one. Not being able to go to the grocery store except during certain hours. Not being able to work on farms anymore. Not being able to walk into a bakery anymore except during certain hours. Not being able to go into a park and sit on a bench unless it said for Jews only. The wearing of the yellow star. And the hours we were allowed to be out before we had to back in the house.”&nbsp;</em></small></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>Before long, Jews were required to carry identity cards like everyone in Germany. However the government added special identify marks to those of Jews. Jewish passports were stamped with a red ‘J’ (for Jude; German for Jew), and Jews who did not possess recognisably Jewish first names were compelled to adopt ‘Jewish middle names. ‘Israel’ for males, and ‘Sara’ for females. With these cards it allowed the police to identify Jews much more easily.&nbsp;</small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><small>Also with these laws, it did not define a Jew as someone with particular religious beliefs. But instead a Jew was defined by having three or four Jewish grandparents. This was regardless whether that individual identified themselves as a Jew or part of the Jewish religious community. Soon many German people who had not practised Judaism for years became subjugated to these laws. People who’s Jewish grandparents had converted to Christianity were also defined as Jewish. </small> </p>

<p class="text-left"><small>Just before midnight on the 9th November, the chief of the Gestapo, Heinrich Müller sent a telegram to all police units informing them that 'demonstrations and actions against jews, as well as jewish homes, businesses and synagogues will take place throughout Germany. And that these actions were not to be interfered with.’&nbsp;</small></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>Instead the orders giving to the police was to instead arrest to arrest the victims. Fire departments were ordered to stand by synagogues that were set ablaze with the explicit instruction to let the building burn to the ground. The only time the fire department were to intervene was if the fire threatened any adjacent ‘Aryan’ properties.&nbsp;</small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><small>Also during this time, Reinhard Heydrich, the Major General of the SS, also sent a telegram instructing local German officers on how to carry out the anti-Jewish measures.&nbsp;</small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><small>The instructions were as follows:&nbsp;</small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><small><strong>a) Only such actions may be carried out which do not threaten German lives or property (e.g., burning of synagogues only when there is no threat of fire to the surroundings).&nbsp;</strong></small></p>
<p class="text-left"><small><strong>b) Stores and residences of Jews may only be destroyed but not looted. The police are instructed to supervise compliance with this order and to arrest looters.&nbsp;</strong></small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><small><strong>c) Special care is to be taken on commercial streets that non-Jewish businesses are completely secured against damage.&nbsp;</strong></small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><small><strong>d) Foreign citizens, even if they are Jewish, may not be molested.&nbsp;</strong></small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><small><strong>2) . . .demonstrations in progress should not be prevented by the police but only supervised for compliance with the guidelines.&nbsp;</strong></small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><small><strong>3) . . .existing archival material is to be impounded by the police in all synagogues and offices of the Jewish community centres to prevent its destruction in the course of the demonstrations. . . . [This material] is to be turned over to the. . . offices of the SD.&nbsp;</strong></small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><small><strong>4) The direction of Security Police [both political and criminal divisions] operations relating to the anti-Jewish demonstrations resides with Political Police authorities except when orders are issued by Security Police inspectors. Officials from the Criminal Police as well as members of the Security Service (SD), of the SS paramilitary units, and of the general SS may be called upon to carry out Security Police operations.&nbsp;</strong></small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><small><strong>5) As soon as the course of events during this night allows the assigned police officers to be used for this purpose, as many Jews—particularly affluent Jews—are to be arrested in all districts as can be accommodated in existing detention facilities. For the time being, only healthy male Jews, whose age is not too advanced, are to be arrested. Immediately after the arrests have been carried out, the appropriate concentration camps should be contacted to place the Jews into camps as quickly as possible. Special care should be taken that Jews arrested on the basis of this instruction are not mistreated.&nbsp;</strong></small></p>
<p class="text-left"><small><strong>6) The contents of this order are to be passed on to the competent Inspectors and Commanders of the Order Police and to regional and local sectors of the SD. . . .</strong></small></p>

<p class="text-left"><small>What took place during the early hours of the morning, and would continue through to the late hours of 10th November, with some places still seeing violence continue for several days after would be become known as Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken Glass. Aptly named because of the glass that littered the streets in the morning.&nbsp;</small></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>The reasoning behind the actions of the 9th-10th November resulted from an incident that happened in Paris two days earlier.&nbsp;</small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><small>On the morning of monday 7th November Herschel Grynszpan shot and killed German diplomat Ernst vom Rath. Grynszpan who after the shooting was immediately arrested and confessed, insisted that his motives of killing Ernst vom Rath was to avenge the jewish people for the actions that the Germans had already taken against them. Most notably the treatment of his family, along with 15,000 deportees who were declared stateless and expelled from Germany to Poland, all the while by being subjugated to harsh conditions. He learned of his family treatment in a postcard sent by his father which in part described ‘the SS men were whipping us, those who lingered they hit and blood was flowing on the road’.&nbsp;</small></p>

		  <p class="text-center"><small><strong><em> -Left: Herschel Grynszpan. -Right: Ernst vom Rath</em></strong></small></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>He was enraged by what his family had said and so brought a revolver, and went straight to the German embassy where he asked to see an embassy official. He was soon taken to the office of vom Rath where Grynszpan then fired 5 rounds, striking vom Rath twice in the abdomen.&nbsp;</small></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>In the evening of November 9th Hitler, who was in Munich at the time, received word that von Rath had died that day from his injuries. In a few short hours, attacks throughout the country against Jews would begin.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</small></p>

		  <p class="text-center"><em><small>&nbsp;<strong>The Boerneplatz synagogue in flames during Kristallnacht,&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankfurt am Main, Germany</strong></small></em></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>In a village near Aachen, teenager Eric Lucas described what he saw,</small></p>
<p class="text-left"><em><small>“…suddenly, with one loud cry of ’down with the Jews’, the gathering outside produced axes and heavy sledgehammers. They advanced towards the little synagogue…burst the door open, and the whole crowd, by now shouting and laughing, stormed into the little house of God."&nbsp;</small></em></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>Another witness, David H. Buffum, an American consul in Leipzig said in his report to Washington,&nbsp;</small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><em><small>“Having demolished dwellings and hurled most of the effects to the streets, the insatiably sadistic perpetrators threw many of the trembling inmates into a small stream that flows through the zoological Park, commanding horrified spectators to spit at them, defile them with mud and jeer at their plight."</small></em></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>During the course of two days, more than 1000 synagogues were burnt and damaged. Rioters ransacked and looted an estimated 7,500 Jewish businesses. They also vandalised Jewish hospitals, homes, schools, and cemeteries. During the attacks 91 Jewish people lost their lives while some 30,000 Jewish males between the age of 16-60 were arrested and sent to concentration camps. Because of the suddenly influx of prisoners, the concentration camps at Dachau, Buchenwald, and Sachsenhausen had to be expanded to accommodate them.&nbsp;</small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><small>After the attacks, the cost of the damages were extremely high. The cost of the broken windows alone came to millions of Reichmarks. The Jewish community were forced to clean up the mess, as well as clear out the rubble from the burnt synagogues. The government also imposed a collective one of one billion Reichmarks (an estimated $400 million in 1938) on the Jewish community as well.</small></p>
