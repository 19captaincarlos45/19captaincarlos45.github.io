		    Deportation&nbsp; </h3>
			<p class="text-left"> <small>As world war II progressed, and Germany captured more land land from countries in the east, Hitler found himself, in his eyes, to be burdened with the Jews of Western Europe. To combat this, the ‘Final Solution’ to the Jewish question was implemented. In January 1942 the Nazis began the systematic deportation of Jews from all over Nazi occupied Europe to six main extermination camps that were established in German occupied Poland. These camps were called Chelmno, Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and Majdanek.&nbsp;</small></p>

	      <p class="text-left"><small>The Jews were transported to these camp via the railway. They were crammed into cattle trucks, often nearly 100 people per wagon. The conditions inside were horrific. Overcrowded, they were forced to stand, and were denied food and water, for days. Sanitation in the truck was non-existent. A toilet consisted of one bucket, which quickly overflowed.&nbsp;</small></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>For some, the conditions inside the cattle trucks were unbearable and many died on the journey before they even reached the camps. Those the did survive were sorted into two lines on arrival. One line was sent to the gas chambers for immediate execution, the other were sent to work as slave labours in the camps.&nbsp;</small> </p>

		  <p class="text-left"><small>A news bulletin issued by the Greek Information Office, described the conditions on the trains.&nbsp;</small></p>
<p class="text-left"><em><small>“The conditions under which these victims of German barbarism were transported were terrible. The trucks into which men, women and children, healthy and sick alike, were loaded, were of the type normally used to transport coal and wood, and only had one entrance which closes hermetically with an iron bar, and a small railed window at the top corner. The germans closed even this small window with barbed wire, thus making impossible any communication with the outside. These Jews had to remain two whole days in the trucks, which remained at the railway station before the train started on its journey.”&nbsp;</small></em></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>A Jewish survivor of the holocaust, explains in an interview her experiences during the deportation to the camps.&nbsp;</small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><em><small>“The entire population of our hospital was walked to the place where the cattle cars were. Then we were loaded. It was a horrible thing, because people had to stand, there were no places to sit or squat. If somebody was sick or even dying, he died on his feet standing up. It was just, unbearable. Water was the worst, the lack of water, the thirst was the worst.”&nbsp;</small></em></p>

          <p class="text-left"><small>Another holocaust survivor explained her experience during the deportation of Hungarians Jews in 1944.&nbsp;</small></p>
<p class="text-left"><em><small>“The Hungarians gave us over to the SS. Here we became a number, we lost our human identity. Then we noticed the cattle cars, we still didn’t know why the cattle cars were there, but pretty soon we knew. 85 of us were pushed up to a cattle car. It was so crowded that we couldn’t stand at first. We were trying to stand but finally moving around in the semi darkness, we settled and sat down on the floor. And then after six days we stopped."</small></em></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>Hugo Gryn, then thirteen, recalls the deportation from Barehovo to Auschwitz.&nbsp;</small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"><em><small>“By noon, inside the wagon it was unbearably hot and the bucket in the box stunk to high heavens. There were plenty of food (hardly anyone at), but the water barrel was nearly exhausted and the little water that was still left in it was warm and full of dirt. I sat down. There was not room for everyone, so we had to sit between each others’ legs. In front of me Gabi, and Dad behind. We were not talking. The train raced with time itself and I was beginning to go mad. The heat, the thirst, the dirt - everything seemed to conspire against me.” </small></em></p>

		    The Camps&nbsp;&nbsp; </h3>
		  <p class="text-left"> <small>When the deportation trains arrived at the extermination camps, the deportees were forced into a line as part of a selection process, which was often completed by an SS physician. The men were separated from woman and children. Going down the line, the SS physician would look at each person to decide whether or not they were healthy and strong enough for forced labour, and then they would point either to the left or right.&nbsp;</small></p>

<p class="text-center"> <small><strong><em>Hungarian Jews line up on the ramp for selection at the Auschwitz-Birkenau killing centre, May 1944</em></strong>&nbsp;</small></p>
		  <p class="text-left"> <small>Once the two lines were complete, one would go off to the gas chambers for execution, while the others were integrated into the camps for forced labour work. Babies, children under the age of 15, pregnant woman, the elderly, and the sick and disabled, had little chance of surviving this first selection and were almost always sent straight to the gas chambers. </small> </p>
<p class="text-left"><small>One woman described her experience when she arrived at Auschwitz.&nbsp;</small></p>
<p class="text-left"><em><small>“When I first came to Auschwitz, we were marched to an area, where they shaved our heads, we were undressed, and were given grey dresses. No underwear, just a grey dress and wooden shoes.”&nbsp;</small></em></p>
          <p class="text-left"><small>Another women described the sorting process at the camps arrival.&nbsp;</small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><em><small>“If one didn’t look right for whatever reason to the particular person doing the selection, they would stand there with a stick, [pointing] to the right or to the left as you ran by them. One never knew if they were in the good line of the bad line. One line would take you to the gas chambers, the other line would go back to the camp and to the barracks to live another day.”&nbsp;</small></em></p>
          <img src="../images/inside gas chamber.png" alt="Bootstrap Image Preview" width="500" height="602" class="img-fluid">
          <p class="text-center"><small><b><i>Inside one of the gas chambers at Auschwitz I&nbsp;</i></b></small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><small>The ones who had been selected to be killed, were led to the gas chambers, which were set up and designed to look like showers so as not to spread panic. Before they entered they were ordered to hand over all the valuables they had on and to undress. They were then led into the shower block under the guise the they were ridding themselves of lice. Once the 'shower room’ was filled up, (the one at Auschwitz was said to hold up to 2,000 prisoners at a time), the guards then locked them inside and either used carbon monoxide that was piped into the chamber, or threw down pellets of Zyklon B, a highly poisonous insecticide, through air shafts built into the ceiling.</small></p>

          <p class="text-center"><small><strong><em>A model of Cremetoria II on display at Auschwitz</em></strong></small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><small>An entry from Leib Langfus’ diary, which was found buried near the remains of crematorium III, describes what he witnessed during his work as a Sonderkommando at Auschwitz, (prisoners tasked with the disposal of gas chamber victims).&nbsp;</small></p>
<p class="text-left"><em><small>“It would be difficult to even imagine that so many people would fit in such a small room. Anyone who did not want to go inside was shot or torn apart by the dogs. They would have suffocated from the lack of air within several hours. Then all the doors were sealed tight and the gas thrown in by way of a small hole in the ceiling. There was nothing more that the people inside could do. And so they only screamed in bitter, lamentable voices. Others complained in voices full of despair, and others still sobbed spasmodically and sent up a dire, heart-rending weeping. ... And in the meantime, their voices grew weaker and weaker ... Because of the great crowding, people fell one atop another as they died, until a heap arose consisting of five or six layers atop the other, reaching a height of one meter. Mothers froze in a seated position on the ground embracing their children in their arms, and husbands and wives died hugging each other. Some of the people made up a formless mass. Others stood in a leaning position, while the upper parts, from the stomach up, were in a lying position. Some of the people had turned completely blue under the influence of the gas, while others looks entirely fresh, as if they were asleep."</small></em></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>After the prisoner were gassed, Sonderkommando were tasked to remove the bodies. They had to remove any glasses and artificial limbs, as well as shaving off the women’s hair. This process was different at other exterminations camps such as Belzec, Sobibor, and Treblinka were the hair was shaved before they entered the gas chambers. Either way the hair was cleaned in a solution sal ammoniac, dried, combed and place in paper bags ready to be shipped off to various companies. When Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviets, the Red Army had found 7,000kg of human hair ready to be shipped.&nbsp;</small></p>
          <img src="../images/camp Kanada.png" alt="Bootstrap Image Preview" class="img-fluid">
          <p class="text-center"><small><strong><em>Collections of clothing, glasses, Jewellery, and other personal items stored at Auschwitz's storage warehouses nicknamed 'Kanada'&nbsp; </em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><small>But it wasn’t just human hair that was collected. Any pieces of jewellery were removed before cremation along with any gold teeth and fillings. By the start of 1944, an estimated 10-12kg of gold was being extracted on a monthly basis from victims teeth. Afterwards the bodies were burned in the nearby incinerators and the ashes were either buried, thrown in rivers, or used as fertiliser. In Auschwitz over a 1,000 bodies were cremated daily.&nbsp;</small></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>Life in the camps for the people that were spared the gas chambers and forced to work as slave labours was terrible. In Auschwitz alone a prisoners life expectancy was only 6 weeks - 3 months. The prisoners were subjected to long days of work starting from 4:30 in the morning. They were kept in wooden barracks, that had no windows and were not insulated by the heat or cold. The Baracks lacked a bathroom with only a bucket as a substitute. Typically the Baracks would hold around 36 wooden bunkbeds, and prisoners were five to six in a bunk. There was as many as 500 prisoners inside a single barrack.&nbsp;</small></p>

          <p class="text-left"><small>They had very limited food and water, with food often consisting of a watery soup that was made with rotten vegetables and meat, which provide very little nutrients, a few ounces of bread, a bit of margarine, tea, or a bitter drink that resembled coffee.&nbsp;</small></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>Diarrhoea was common in the camps, and because there was hardly any sanitation many diseases such as Typhus, Tuberculosis, Meningitis, and Dysentery ran rampart, killing thousands in the camps.&nbsp;</small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><small>In Auschwitz in particular, men, women and children were subjected to cruel medical experiments, by SS physician Dr. Josef Mengele, who was nicknamed ‘the angel of death.’ He carried out experiments on dwarfs and twins. Most people who were experiment on often did not survive the process or were killed outright after research was completed.&nbsp;</small></p>

          <p class="text-center"><small><strong><em> SS physician Dr. Josef Mengele&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><small>By the end of the war an estimated 3,150,000 Jews and other ethnicities were murdered at the extermination camps. Auschwitz had the highest death toll at 1.1 million, followed by 800,000 at Treblinka, 600,000 at Belzec, 320,000 at Chelmno, 250,000 at Sobibor, and at least 80,000 at Majdanek.</small></p>

          <h3 class="text-center" id="the liberation">Liberation</h3>
          <p class="text-left"><small>As the allied armies pushed closer to and into Germany, they soon uncovered the extent of the Nazi death camps. On the 27th January, 1945 soviet troops of the 322nd Rifle Division arrived at Auschwitz, and liberated the three main camps. Auschwitz I, Auschwitz-Birkenau, and Monowitz. Only about 7,000 prisoners had remained at the camp, most of which were seriously ill because of the treatment they endured. The ones left behind consisted mostly of middle aged adults, and children younger than 15.&nbsp;</small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><small>In the week before Soviet forces arrived at Auschwitz, the Germans force marched 60,000 prisoners away from Auschwitz towards concentration camps deeper into the heart of Germany. These marches were nicknamed ‘death marches’ as many prisoners that embarked on them never survived.&nbsp;</small></p>
          <img src="../images/auschwitz liberation.png" alt="Bootstrap Image Preview" width="500" class="img-fluid">
          <p class="text-center"><small><strong><em>Children stand at the barbed wire fence shortly after their liberation at Auschwitz by the Red Army</em></strong>&nbsp;</small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><small>The soldiers that arrived, most who were veterans and used to seeing death were appalled by the treatment of the Jewish prisoners.&nbsp;</small></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>Red Army general Vasily Petrenko who was the commander of the 107th Infantry Division remarked, <em>“I who saw people dying every day was shocked by the Nazi’s indescribable hatred towards the inmates who had turned into living skeletons. I read about the Nazis’ treatment of Jews in various leaflets, but there was nothing about the Nazis’ treatment of women, children, and old men. It was in Auschwitz that I found out about the fate of the Jews."</em></small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><small>Maria Rebhun, recalls being liberated by Soviet troops entering Lauenburg camp in Pomerania: <em>“We were in a daze. Barely moving, supporting the ones who were not able to make a step, and pushing the ones the were already written off in a wheelbarrow, we went to face our new reality. Our minds were like a vacuum, our hearts empty of any desires. On the streets, estates Russian soldiers offered us sweets and cigarettes amidst laughter and songs, but we were mute. Who are we? Where are we to go? Whom to turn to?”&nbsp;</em></small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><small>Over on the western front, British, American, and Canadian forces were soon finding many concentration camps as they advanced into Germany.&nbsp;</small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><small>On the 4th April the first concentration camp in the west was liberated by the 4th Armoured Division and the 89th Infantry of the Third US Army. Inside the camp at Ohrdruf they found the corpses of 4,000 inmates that were killed in the last three months. When General Dwight D. Eisenhower visited the camp a week later he ordered careful documentation of the atrocities.&nbsp;</small></p>

          <p class="text-left"><small>Hugo Gryn recalls his liberation at Gunskirchen in May, 1945.&nbsp;</small></p>
<p class="text-left"><em><small>“It was sunny. Around mid-morning we could hear distant gunfire coming closer, the rumbling of tanks. Suddenly our guards…dropped their guns, stripped off their deaths-head insignia, and started to run. Suddenly there appeared an American tank and that was, as far as I was concerned, the end of the war. On the tanks, the five pointed star of the United States, and crouching behind them, soldiers who took one look at us and began to throw their food rations in our direction before moving on. Behind them followed infantry soldiers, and both fired at the retreating Germans. By the time the blessed and bloody procession had passed beyond our camp - we sat there, silent, unbelieving, and free.”&nbsp;</small></em></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>On the 15th April the 63rd Anti-tank Regiment and the 11th Armoured Division of the British Army entered the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. When the soldiers of the 11th Armoured entered the camp they were unprepared at what they found. Inside there were more the 60,000 emaciated and ill prisoners that were all in need of medical attention. Littered around the camp in various stages of decomposition were the bodies of more than 13,000 prisoners.&nbsp;</small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><small>Mania Salinger, who was liberated in Belsen remembers the moment British tanks entered the camp.&nbsp;</small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><em><small>“Hundreds and then thousands of skeleton-like figures were running to the front gates screaming hysterically. I was up front and saw the first English tank enter the camp. We almost tore these poor soldiers apart. Other tanks followed. Through the loud speakers and with tear-filled voices they repeated over and over again in several languages: “You are free. We are the English army. Be calm. Be calm. Food and medical help is on the way.""&nbsp;&nbsp;</small></em></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>A member of the British Army Film and Photographic unit recalled.&nbsp;</small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><em><small>“The bodies were a ghastly sight. Some were green. They looked like skeletons covered with skin-the flesh had all gone. There were bodies of small children among the grown ups. In other parts of the camp there were hundreds of bodies lying around, in many cases piled five of six high.”&nbsp;</small></em></p>

          <p class="text-center"><small><strong><em>Bergen-Belsen soon after its liberation in April 1945&nbsp;</em></strong></small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><small>British soldier, Peter Coombs, wrote to his wife in a letter about what he witnessed during the first days of the liberation at Bergen-Belsen.&nbsp;</small></p>
<p class="text-left"><em><small>“The sight of these affects one profoundly, for while there is still life and movement, we are interested in their salvation mentally and physically. The conditions in which these people live are appalling. One has to take a tour round and see their faces, their slow staggering gait and feeble movements. The state of their minds is plainly written on their faces, as starvation has reduced their bodies to skeletons. The facts is that all these were once clean-living and sane and certainly not the type to do harm to the Nazis. They are Jews and are dying now at the rate of three hundred a day. They must die and nothing can save them - their end is inescapable, they are too far gone now to be brought back to life. I saw there corpses lying near their hovels, for they crawl or totter out into the sunlight to die. I watched them make their last feeble journeys, and even as I watched they died.”&nbsp;</small></em></p>
<p class="text-left"><small>On the 29th April, American soldiers of the 42nd and 45th Infantry Divisions as well as the 20th Armoured Division entered Dachau. Inside they liberated approximately 32,000 prisoners. Also near the camp they find more than 30 railroad cars filled with bodies brought to Dachau, all of which were in an advanced state of decomposition. soon after the camp was liberated, U.S soldiers rounded up the SS prison guards of the camp and executed them along a wall. approximatly 60 guards were executed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></p>

          <p class="text-left"><small>When soldiers entered the camps, many were desperate to try and alleviate the prisoners starvation by handing out army rations. This first intake of food was fatal for many prisoners, since many were starving and by giving them them too much to eat too quickly they ate themselves to death. Also the Americans were angry by what they had found and forced the local German populations to see the extent of the Nazi atrocities and to help clear and dispose of the dead in the camps, as well as exhuming bodies in mass graves for a proper burial.&nbsp; &nbsp;</small></p>
          <p class="text-left"><small>At the end of World War II the Allies found 6 extermination camps and 44,000 concentration camps, and other incarceration sites, which included ghettos and other facilities.</small></p>
